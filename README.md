# SentinelScan — PS-4: Unified Cross-Platform Malware Detection & Behavioral Analysis Suite

**E-Rakshak 2026 · Round 2 · Team HackersAPK** — Rank 6 Qualifier
Problem Statement: **ERH26_PS_04** — Cybersecurity & Malware Analysis

A localized, evidence-grade platform for police cyber-crime units to statically and dynamically analyze suspicious Android APKs and Windows executables — identifying what data is stolen, where it's sent, and producing a plain-language report an investigator (not just an analyst) can act on.

## Problem Understanding

Police departments encounter endpoints compromised by spyware, RATs, and malicious APKs — light-bill fraud, loan-app scams, fake e-Challan/RTO schemes. Investigators need a safe, isolated environment to scan a suspect/victim device, determine exactly what capability the malware has (SMS theft, GPS tracking, screen capture) and where it exfiltrates to, across **both Windows and Android**, with a report that holds up as evidence and is readable by a non-technical officer.

**Core pipeline (per the PS):**

1. **Static Analysis** — hashing, YARA/signature matching, APK manifest & permission scan, PE inspection, string/URL/IP extraction
2. **Dynamic / Sandbox Analysis** — isolated detonation, API/syscall + network traffic capture, file/registry/SMS access tracking
3. **Behavioral Profiling** — capability classification, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, plain-language summary
4. **Reporting & IOCs** — exportable CSV/STIX, hash-chained evidence-grade logging

**Bonus objectives targeted:** automated MITRE ATT&CK mapping, encrypted-traffic behavioral analysis (metadata-only, no decryption), threat-intel enrichment, offline/air-gapped mode.

## What Makes This Different

4-5 teams are building against the same PS. Our locked differentiators:

| #   | Feature                                                          | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **India-specific scam detection rules**                          | YARA/behavioral signatures tuned to light-bill, loan-app, and e-Challan fraud patterns explicitly named in the PS — most teams build generic malware detection and miss this |
| 2   | **LangGraph agent correlation + plain-language narrative agent** | Turns raw static+dynamic+network signals into an investigator-readable summary instead of a raw log dump                                                                     |
| 3   | **Hash-chained, signed chain-of-custody reporting**              | Evidence-grade, court-ready reports — its own visible dashboard module, not a buried backend feature                                                                         |

**Stretch (Week 4, if time allows):** 24/7 live GCP-hosted sandbox, encrypted-traffic metadata analysis (JA3 fingerprinting), Geo-IP mapping, AI-generated investigative recommendations, malware family tagging.

## Architecture

Six-layer pipeline — full diagram at [`infra/PS4_Architecture.drawio`](./infra/PS4_Architecture.drawio) (open in [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net)):

```
Ingestion & Isolation Layer
        ↓
Static Analysis Engine        (APK/PE modules, YARA, ML classifier)
        ↓
Dynamic / Sandbox Analysis    (KVM + CAPE on GCP, Android-x86 + Frida, INetSim)
        ↓
Behavioral Correlation & Agentic Reasoning   ← differentiator layer
   (LangGraph Orchestrator → MITRE Mapper → Capability Classifier → Narrative Agent)
        ↓
Storage & Serving             (PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Redis)
        ↓
Output                        (React Dashboard, IOC Export, Signed PDF Report)
```

**Deployment model:** two-plane architecture — a public Control Plane (dashboard/API, port 443 only) and an isolated Detonation Plane (GCP `n2-standard-4`, nested virtualization, KVM/CAPE, network-contained via INetSim). See [Deployment](#deployment) below.

## Getting Started

### Backend / infra

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill in GROQ_API_KEY, NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY, GCP project details
docker-compose up -d      # Postgres + Redis + Elasticsearch
```

### Agent orchestrator (standalone test)

```bash
pip install -r agents/orchestrator/requirements.txt
python agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.py
```

Runs the LangGraph pipeline against mock static-analysis data — confirms the graph end-to-end without needing the live sandbox.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Full plan with daily/task-level detail: see `docs/` and the project plan PDF.

## Deployment

**Control Plane** (public): Dashboard, API, DB — reverse-proxied via Nginx + Let's Encrypt, port 443 only.

**Detonation Plane** (isolated): GCP `n2-standard-4`, Ubuntu 22.04, nested virtualization enabled at creation. KVM/QEMU + CAPE for Windows detonation with auto-reverting golden snapshot; Android-x86 QEMU VM with Frida. All victim-VM traffic routed through INetSim — no real internet access, so captured C2/exfil behavior is observed safely. SSH-only management access; only the Control Plane is internet-facing.

Cost: $0 for the full hackathon timeline — new GCP account's $300/90-day trial credit covers it.

## Contributing Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<short-description>
# ...make changes...
git add .
git commit -m "clear, specific message"
git push -u origin feature/<short-description>
# open a PR into main
```

- Never commit real malware samples — `dynamic-sandbox/samples/` and `*.apk`/`*.exe` are gitignored
- Never commit `.env` — use `.env.example` as the template
- Keep `docs/weekX.md` updated every week, not just at submission time

---

**Submission:** Final prototype, documentation, PPT, and demo video submitted via Unstop at end of Week 4.
